                What is Polkadot?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Polkadot is a layer-0 blockchain protocol that enables
                interoperability between multiple layer-1 blockchains (roll-ups)
                under shared security. Developers build on Polkadot to create
                scalable, interoperable, and secure blockchain applications,
                leveraging its modular framework, cross-chain communication
                (XCM), and robust developer tools like the Polkadot SDK.
                It&apos;s ideal for projects needing custom blockchains, smart
                contracts, or cross-chain functionality. Learn more at{" "}

              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Polkadot Hub is a central gateway for creating and trading
                assets, deploying Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, and
                accessing native Polkadot featuresâ€”all within Polkadot&apos;s

                How do I choose between building a roll up (parachain), or smart

                    Roll ups (parachains) are ideal for custom blockchains with
                    constant activity, making them a tailored solution for
                    enterprises building specialized use cases, such as supply
                    chain tracking, financial settlement systems, or private
                    data management. They offer full control over governance,
                    consensus, and performance, enabling scalable and secure
                    infrastructure for large-scale projects with dedicated
                    resources. Roll ups are well-suited for organizations
                    needing robust, long-term blockchain solutions with high
                    throughput and interoperability.

                    Smart contracts are best for consumer-facing applications,
                    such as DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, or gaming dApps,
                    providing flexibility in development time and resource
                    needs. Small teams or startups can quickly prototype and
                    deploy using familiar tools like Solidity or Ink!,
